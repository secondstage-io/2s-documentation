### Use Cases

![Timeline](/assets/overview_timeline.png "Marketing Timeline")

**Announcement Phase**  

During the announcement phase, publishers and developers aim to build awareness and excitement for their upcoming game. TRACKS helps monitor media analytics to assess the reach and impact of campaigns across multiple channels — paid advertising, social media or influencers.

At this stage of the campaign, TRACKS can measure the impact of media campaigns and creative assets, track performance in the awareness funnel, and provide helpful brand health insights to support critical decision making on key marketing beats.

**Pre Launch**  

In the pre launch phase, upper funnel activations that drive brand recognition are still important. This stage also puts significant emphasize on measuring website traffic and optimizing conversion rates through detailed web analytics, ensuring that campaigns are reaching high quality users and delivering on wishlists or pre-purchases.

TRACKS enables precise tracking of where users are coming from — whether through web traffic, referrals, paid ads, or influencer promotions. It connects campaign data with wishlists, preorders or installs, helping gaming companies identify which platforms or channels are key to create demand. 

**Launch Phase**  

When the game launches, TRACKS provides real-time insights into user acquisition. Here, attribution tracking becomes critical.

TRACKS blends data from all sources - media, website and attribution - enabling us to identify which campaigns lead to the most sales across PC and console. This granular data allows companies to understand which players are not only visiting a storefront, but actually purchasing the game.

**Post Launch**  

Beyond launch, ongoing marketing campaigns focus on retention and maximizing in-game purchases. 

TRACKS continues to analyze the effectiveness of media campaigns, providing insights on how to re-engage lapsed players or drive additional in-game purchases through targeted advertising. Web analytics provide deeper insight into how players interact with updates, events, or expansions on the game's website. With postbacks enabled, attribution tracking can provide valuable data on in-game segments, allowing us to optimize for DLC sales and other events.

!!! tip "Important:"

    Throughout the entire customer journey, TRACKS empowers gaming companies with the marketing intelligence needed to make data-driven decisions. From the initial announcement to long after launch, it integrates media analytics, PC & console attribution, install and purchase tracking, and web analytics to provide a full-funnel view of campaign performance. This holistic approach ensures that every stage of the customer journey is optimized for maximum impact and revenue growth.

## Functionality

### User Account Setup 

TRACKS uses Magic Link technology to simplify the account setup process, eliminating the need for passwords. Here's how it works:

1. **Sign-Up/Sign-In**: When you enter your email address on the TRACKS login or sign-up page, a unique, secure link is sent to your inbox.
   
2. **Access Your Email**: Check your email for a message from TRACKS. This email will contain the Magic Link—a one-time-use URL that provides access to your account.

3. **Click the Magic Link**: Simply click the link in the email, and you’ll be automatically logged into your account without needing to enter a password.

4. **One-Time Use**: The Magic Link is valid for a limited time and can only be used once for security purposes. If the link expires or is used, you can request a new one by entering your email again.

This streamlined process enhances both security and user experience by avoiding the need for traditional passwords while ensuring account access remains secure.
