### User Account Setup 

TRACKS uses Magic Link technology to simplify the account setup process, eliminating the need for passwords. Here's how it works:

1. **Sign-Up/Sign-In**: When you enter your email address on the TRACKS login or sign-up page, a unique, secure link is sent to your inbox.
   
2. **Access Your Email**: Check your email for a message from TRACKS. This email will contain the Magic Link—a one-time-use URL that provides access to your account.

3. **Click the Magic Link**: Simply click the link in the email, and you’ll be automatically logged into your account without needing to enter a password.

4. **One-Time Use**: The Magic Link is valid for a limited time and can only be used once for security purposes. If the link expires or is used, you can request a new one by entering your email again.

This streamlined process enhances both security and user experience by avoiding the need for traditional passwords while ensuring account access remains secure.
