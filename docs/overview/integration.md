# Integration Support

To integrate TRACKS, every user receives:

- A kickoff meeting with our team to walk through the integration process.

- A personalised integration plan tailored to their product and data flow.

These resources are designed to guide you through the setup steps described in this documentation page.

## Integration Plan

Your **TRACKS Integration Plan** is a personalized roadmap that outlines all the key steps required to set up TRACKS, including **TRACKS attribution**. It’s designed to guide you through the process with clarity and confidence.

Each task in the plan includes:

- **Task name**: What needs to be done  
- **Status**: Live updates on progress  
- **Owner**: Who is responsible  
- **Category & section**: Where the task fits in the overall setup  
- **Due date**: When it's expected to be completed  
- **Notes**: Additional context or links

To support your team during setup:

- You’ll receive **email notifications** when key milestones are completed.  
- We offer the option to join a **shared Discord group** with all stakeholders.  
- Meetings can be scheduled at any time for **direct support** from the TRACKS team.

This plan ensures full visibility and coordination across technical and marketing teams during integration.
