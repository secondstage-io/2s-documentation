## What is Marketing Analytics in Gaming?

Marketing analytics involves collecting, measuring, analyzing, and interpreting data from marketing campaigns to understand their effectiveness and optimize future efforts. In gaming, marketing analytics is crucial due to the highly competitive and rapidly evolving nature of the market, where player acquisition, engagement, and retention directly impact revenue and growth.

Unlike traditional marketing, gaming campaigns often require deep integration with user behavior data, in-game events, and platform-specific metrics to capture the full player journey—from initial ad exposure to gameplay milestones and monetization.

## Why Is Marketing Analytics Important for Games?

- **Performance Measurement:** Understand which campaigns, channels, and creatives drive installs, registrations, and purchases.  
- **Budget Optimization:** Allocate marketing spend efficiently by investing more in high-ROI channels and cutting underperforming ones.  
- **Audience Segmentation:** Identify valuable player segments for targeted messaging and personalized offers.  
- **Player Retention Insights:** Track how marketing impacts long-term player engagement and lifetime value (LTV).  
- **Fraud Detection & Quality Control:** Spot irregular patterns to mitigate install fraud or low-quality user acquisition.  
- **Cross-Channel Attribution:** Attribute player actions to the right marketing touchpoints, even when users interact across multiple devices or platforms.  

## Key KPIs in Gaming Marketing Analytics

TRACKS focuses on the critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that gaming marketers rely on to evaluate campaign success:

- **Installs:** The total number of new players acquired from marketing efforts.  
- **Cost Per Install (CPI):** Average cost to acquire a new player through paid campaigns.  
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS):** Revenue generated per dollar spent on advertising, often measured over specific time windows (e.g., Day 1, Day 7, Day 30).  
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Percentage of users who clicked on an ad out of total impressions, indicating ad engagement.  
- **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of users who took a desired action (install, purchase) after clicking or viewing an ad.  
- **Cost Per Mille (CPM):** Cost per 1,000 ad impressions, useful for measuring the efficiency of awareness campaigns.  
- **View Rate:** Percentage of video ad impressions that are actually viewed (based on platform viewability standards), important for evaluating creative performance and engagement.  
- **Cost Per Qualified View (CPQ):** A modeled version of CPM that reflects only meaningful or qualified views—such as ads that resulted in a user action or sustained engagement—providing a deeper look into campaign quality beyond raw impressions.

- **Analyze by geography (GEO):** Understand regional performance differences to tailor localization and marketing spend.  
- **Track campaign beats:** Monitor specific time-bound campaigns or creative refreshes to optimize timing and messaging.  
- **Drill down by player cohorts:** Segment players based on acquisition date, campaign source, or behavior to analyze retention and monetization patterns.
