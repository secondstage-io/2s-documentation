# Steamworks Integration

## Overview

Steamworks access is required to enable marketing attribution on Steam. It provides secure access to app-specific data (e.g., Steam App ID, user actions, transaction events) that can be used to match off-platform campaign metadata with on-platform conversions. This access is important for activating attribution pipelines and integrating with TRACKS.

## Steamworks Access

If your game is available on Steam, please grant us access by sending an invitation to analytics@secondstage.io with "View Marketing Traffic Data" permissions only.

You can find the "Invite New User" section in Steamworks by navigating to Steamworks → Users & Permissions → Invite New User.
