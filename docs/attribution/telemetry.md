# Telemetry

If your game does not yet have a backend system for telemetry or event logging, our team can support you in setting one up—whether you're using **Unity** or **Unreal Engine**.

We provide guidance on:

- Integrating client-side telemetry scripts
- Sending key gameplay events (e.g. installs, level progress, purchases)
- Connecting telemetry to the TRACKS attribution pipeline

This ensures you can fully benefit from TRACKS' attribution and analytics capabilities.

> **Get in touch with us** to discuss telemetry setup options tailored to your game’s architecture.
